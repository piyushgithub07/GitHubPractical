3.The encrypted connection helps ensure that sensitive data is safely transmitted

Working of VPN:-
1.A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. 
2.This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data.
3.This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online. 
4.A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into "gibberish". 
5.Even if someone were to get their hands on your data, it would be useless

Hereâ€™s how to surf securely with a VPN:-
1.Once you are online, start your VPN. The VPN acts as a secure tunnel between you and the internet. 
2.Your ISP and other third parties cannot detect this tunnel.
3.Your device is now on the local network of the VPN, and your IP address can be changed to an IP address provided by the VPN server.
You can now surf the internet at will, as the VPN protects all your personal data.
